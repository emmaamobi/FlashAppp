## What is Flashapp?
Flashapp is a fun program that students can use to study for tests. Users can
create a set of flashcards and then use a variety of game modes including:
* Browse 
* Random
* LIFO
* FIFO

##Flashcard Creation
Users can create a flashcard set by entering the term and definition of each card. There
is no limit on the amount of cards a user can create.

##Browse Mode
After flashcard creation, users can browse their flashcards using Browse mode. Browse mode
allows for users to go back and forth between each card in the set. Additionally, users
can flip each card to see the term and definition and they can edit both the terms and 
definitions of a card even after creation. 

##Random Mode
The user can use random mode to test themselves using a created flashcard set. This mode will select
a random flashcard from the set, in no particular order.

##LIFO Mode
LIFO mode tests the user on the created flashcard set in the reverse order of entry.

##FIFO Mode
FIFO mode tests the user on the created flashcard set in order of entry.
